### Hi Friend,
#### Biomimicry is Beautiful. I believe designing technology, tools, and structures as close to the design you see in creation is the most effective way to achieve our desired outcomes. This is why I love software engineering. It is answering the question “How can I create a system to mimic a function of the brain so that things can get done faster, more sustainably, and with less effort on us humans?” This is why I am a software engineer.

#### My name is Matt Wood and I am a Microsoft Software and Systems Academy graduate with an understanding of cloud development technologies and ASP.net. Comfortable in a constant learning and improvement environment. 7 years of experience as a Project Manager and 6 years of service to the United States Air Force.
